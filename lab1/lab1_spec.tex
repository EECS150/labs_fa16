\section{Before You Start This Lab}

Before you proceed with the contents of this lab, be sure that you have gone through and completed the steps involved in Lab 0. There is no checkoff for Lab 0, but there will be for this lab. Let the TA know if you are not signed up for this class on bCourses and Piazza or if you do not have a class account (eecs151-xxx), so we can get that sorted out. Also, please go through the Verilog Primer slides that are linked to on Piazza; you should feel somewhat comfortable with the basics of Verilog to complete this lab.\\

To fetch the skeleton files for this lab \verb|cd| to the git repository (\verb|labs_fa16|) that you had cloned in Lab 0 and execute the command \verb|git pull|.
